# tensorflow-learning
Starting a Tensorflow 

- tensorflow-1: simple linear regression
- tensorflow-2: linear regression with gradient descent
- tensorflow-3: binary classification with logistic function, very simple, from scratch
- tensorflow-4: multi-class classification with softmax
- tensorflow-5: xor learning; shallow, 2-layer, and multi-layer deep.
- tensorflow-6: tensor graph fro data visualization, very simple
- tensorflow-7: convolution network, only 1 filter to learn the 3x3 sobel operator.
